Babel(JS compiler)
- converts JSX to JS during build 

SPA (single page app)
- dynamic loading (laod res like HTML, CSS, JS) dynamically as needed 
- smooth transition (like nav without page refreshes)
- client side rendering 
- uses AJAX (to fetch and send data async data without reloading the entire page)
Disadvantages:- Intial load time (large JS bundle size) ; SEO challenges (struggle to index dynamic content)

DATABASE:-

MongoDB - NoSQL, schema less, stores data in BSON(binary JSON), for large amount of unstructured data
SQL DB - pre defined schema, structured(tables), uses SQL, 
GraphQL (query landuage)
- reduces over and under fetching (can specific the structure of response)
- request multiple resources in a single request 
- can be used with both SQL/NoSQL
Redis - used for caching (where access to low latency access to data is crucial)
